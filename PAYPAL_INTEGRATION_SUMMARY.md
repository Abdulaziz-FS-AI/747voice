# PayPal Integration Summary

## Overview
I've successfully integrated PayPal as the payment provider for Voice Matrix, replacing Stripe. Here's what has been implemented:

## Backend Implementation

### 1. PayPal Service (`src/lib/services/paypal.service.ts`)
- Complete PayPal API integration
- OAuth token management with caching
- Subscription creation and management
- Webhook signature verification
- Payment history tracking
- Invoice generation support

### 2. Payment Service (`src/lib/services/payment.service.ts`)
- Updated to use PayPal instead of Stripe
- Handles checkout sessions
- Manages subscription lifecycle
- Processes webhook events

### 3. API Routes
- `/api/subscription/checkout` - Creates PayPal subscription
- `/api/subscription/paypal/activate` - Activates subscription after approval
- `/api/subscription/paypal/webhook` - Handles PayPal webhooks
- `/api/subscription/payment-history` - Retrieves payment history
- `/api/subscription/invoice/[id]` - Generates invoices
- `/api/subscription/portal` - Redirects to PayPal account management

### 4. Database Schema (`supabase/migrations/004_paypal_integration.sql`)
- Added PayPal-specific fields to profiles table
- Created payment_history table
- Created invoices table
- Created paypal_webhook_events table for idempotency
- Updated RLS policies

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. PayPal Button Component (`src/components/payment/paypal-button.tsx`)
- Integrated PayPal SDK
- Handles subscription creation
- Manages approval flow
- Shows loading states

### 2. Upgrade Button (`src/components/subscription/upgrade-button.tsx`)
- Modal with plan details
- PayPal button integration
- Success/cancel handling

### 3. Billing Page Updates
- Updated to show PayPal UI
- Payment history display
- Invoice download support
- Success/cancel URL parameter handling

### 4. Cancel Subscription Modal (`src/components/subscription/cancel-subscription-modal.tsx`)
- Feedback collection
- Retention information
- Graceful cancellation flow

## Setup & Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables (`PAYPAL_ENV_VARS.md`)
Required variables:
```bash
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox # or 'live'
PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID=your-webhook-id
PAYPAL_PRO_PLAN_ID=P-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### 2. Setup Script (`src/scripts/setup-paypal.ts`)
Run `npm run setup:paypal` to:
- Create PayPal products
- Create subscription plans
- Get plan IDs for configuration

## Key Features

1. **Subscription Management**
   - Create, activate, cancel subscriptions
   - Handle upgrades and downgrades
   - Track subscription status

2. **Payment Processing**
   - Secure PayPal checkout
   - Webhook event processing
   - Payment history tracking

3. **User Experience**
   - Seamless upgrade flow
   - Clear cancellation process
   - Payment history visibility

4. **Security**

   - Idempotent webhook processing
   - Secure token management

## Testing Checklist

1. [ ] Run `npm install` to install tsx dependency
2. [ ] Run `npm run setup:paypal` to create products/plans
3. [ ] Add PayPal credentials to `.env.local`
4. [ ] Configure webhooks in PayPal dashboard
5. [ ] Test subscription creation with sandbox account
6. [ ] Verify webhook processing
7. [ ] Test cancellation flow
8. [ ] Check payment history display

## Next Steps

1. **Invoice PDF Generation**: Implement PDF generation for invoices
2. **Email Notifications**: Add email notifications for subscription events
3. **Analytics**: Add subscription analytics dashboard
4. **Testing**: Complete end-to-end testing in sandbox mode
5. **Production**: Switch to live mode when ready

## Important Notes

- Always test with sandbox accounts first
- PayPal subscriptions have different states than Stripe
- Webhooks must be configured for each environment
- Plan IDs are environment-specific (sandbox vs live)
